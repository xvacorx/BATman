This tool is made to check if a list of devices respond to the network.

ips.txt needs to be edited and filled with the list of ips (or hostnames) to be pinged (one per line).

Once ips.txt is done, run Ping.bat or Detailed_Ping.bat. This will start the process for each ip.

When the process finishes a Results.txt file will appear in the folder.

Differences:

Ping.bat: Only shows if the ping was ok or not and the IP in return

Detailed_Ping.bat: Tries to recover additional information about the device than Ping.bat. For Example MAC Address and Host Name.
