# Generate Hash

This script generates a comprehensive hash of your computer's current state and saves it as a `.cab` file in your `C:\` directory.

## What it Does

The script collects system information and calculates a hash, providing a snapshot of your system's configuration. This can be useful for baseline comparisons, troubleshooting, or general system monitoring.

## Usage

1.  Double-click `Generate_Hash.bat`.
2.  The script will run, and upon completion, a `.cab` file containing the generated hash will be created in your `C:\` drive.
