# Generate Hash

This script generates a comprehensive hash of your computer's current state and saves it as a `.cab` file in your `C:\` directory.

## What it Does

The script collects system information and calculates a hash, providing a snapshot of your system's configuration. This can be useful for baseline comparisons, troubleshooting, or general system monitoring.

Okay, I'll provide the usage instructions in Markdown format, incorporating all the requested points.

## Usage

1.  Double-click **`GenerateHash.bat`**.
2.  A **User Account Control (UAC) prompt** will appear, asking for administrator access (this is essential for collecting all the device information).
3.  The script will run. Upon completion, a folder named **`MDMLogs`** will be created (or used if it already exists) in the same drive where the script is located. Inside this folder, a `.cab` file named after the device's **serial number** (e.g., `SERIALNUMBER.cab`) will be generated.
