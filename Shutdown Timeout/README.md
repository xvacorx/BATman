# Shutdown Timeout

Schedules a timed shutdown for your Windows system, perfect for automated power management, energy saving, or ensuring your PC shuts down after a period of inactivity.

## How it Works

This script allows you to set a timer for your computer to automatically shut down. You can configure the duration, making it useful for scenarios like ensuring your computer turns off after a large download, a backup completes, or simply to conserve energy overnight.

## Usage

(You'll need to provide the actual usage instructions for `Shutdown_Timeout.bat` here. For example, does it prompt the user for a time? Does it read from a file? Is it inactivity-based? Once you provide that, I can fill this section in.)
