# Copy to Startup

A quick utility to easily add files or shortcuts to your Windows Startup folder, ensuring they run automatically when you log in.

## How it Works

This script automatically copies all files (excluding `README.md` and the `Copy_to_Startup.bat` script itself) from its containing folder into your Windows Startup directory (`shell:startup`).

This is perfect for setting up applications, documents, or scripts that you want to launch every time you start your computer.

## Usage

1.  Place the `Copy_to_Startup.bat` file in the same folder as the files or shortcuts you want to add to Startup.
2.  Double-click `Copy_to_Startup.bat`.
3.  The relevant files will be copied to your Startup folder.
