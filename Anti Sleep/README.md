These .bat files were made to prevent windows sleep and log out while inactive.

Anti_Sleep moves the cursor 1 pixel every 60 seconds. It should be added into startup folder for better performance.

Allow_Sleep kills Anti_Sleep process, allowing the device to enter sleep mode again without needing to restart.
