### How to Use

You have a few options to get started with BATman scripts:

1.  **Explore Script Folders:**
    * Find the script you're interested in within the "Available Scripts" table.
    * Click the "**Go to Folder**" link to view its contents directly on GitHub, including its dedicated `README.md` for detailed instructions.

2.  **Download Individual Scripts (Recommended for quick use):**
    * Find the script you need in the "Available Scripts" table.
    * Click the "**Download ZIP**" link in the corresponding row. This will take you to the DownGit website in your current browser tab.
    * On the DownGit page, **click the 'Download' button** (which typically appears at the top) to initiate the `.zip` file download for that specific script's folder.
    * Extract the downloaded `.zip` file.
    * Navigate into the extracted folder.

3.  **Clone the Entire Repository:**
    If you prefer to have the full collection and keep it updated with Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/xvacorx/BATman.git](https://github.com/xvacorx/BATman.git)
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download the entire repository as a ZIP file directly from GitHub's main page.

4.  **Run the Script:**
    Once you have the script's folder (either by downloading or cloning), simply double-click the `.bat` file inside it. Please note that some scripts may require administrative privileges (right-click on the `.bat` file and select "Run as administrator") depending on their function.

**Important Note:** Each script's dedicated folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed instructions and explanations specific to that particular `.bat` script.
